# Fix Flv Multiple Resolutions
This console app fixes flv files which are generally downloaded from webcam streams and have trouble playing.

This generally happens with files coming from replay media catcher. Stream starts with low resolution, then high resolution is selected, so first part of the file is low resolution and causes instable behaviours in media players. This code removes this part.

# Usage
Drop and drag your flv file(s) to this application.
Note:If you don't know how to build, just take the .exe file in bin/debug folder and use it.
